CRITICAL WARNING: [Vivado 12-1790] Evaluation License Warning: This design contains one or more evaluation cores that will cease to function after a certain period of time. This design should NOT be used in production systems.

Evaluation cores found in this design:
    IP core 'rs_encoder' (rs_encoder_v9_0_16) was generated using a hardware_evaluation license.
    IP core 'mac_phy_ten_gig_eth_mac_ch0_0' (ten_gig_eth_mac_v15_1_9) was generated using a design_linking license.
    IP core 'mac_phy_ten_gig_eth_pcs_pma_ch0_0' (ten_gig_eth_pcs_pma_v6_0_18) was generated using a design_linking license.

Resolution: If a new IP Core license was added, in order for the new license to be picked up, the current netlist needs to be updated by resetting and re-generating the IP output products before bitstream generation.

WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0
