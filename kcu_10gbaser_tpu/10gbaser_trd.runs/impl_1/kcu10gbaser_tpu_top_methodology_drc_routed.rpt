2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock clk_250m is created on an inappropriate pin tpu_clock_mm/inst/clkout1_buf/O. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_250m is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_tpu_clock_mm and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks mac_phy_ch0_txusrclk2_out and refclk_p are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks mac_phy_ch0_txusrclk2_out] -to [get_clocks refclk_p]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks refclk_p and mac_phy_ch0_txusrclk2_out are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks refclk_p] -to [get_clocks mac_phy_ch0_txusrclk2_out]

Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
